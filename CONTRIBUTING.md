# Contributing

To develop this project locally you will need to be running [NodeJS v18](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm v9](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Environment Variables

If you have not done so already, fork this repository to your account and clone it. Then, change into the directory and copy the `sample.env` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

First, you'll need to head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.dev) and create your application.

- Select the `Applications` tab on the left sidebar.
- Click the `New Application` button.
- Give your application a name and click `Create`.
- Select the `Bot` tab on the left sidebar.
- Click the `Add Bot` button.
- Click the `Copy` button to copy your bot's token.

Paste that token as `TOKEN` in your `.env` file. Switch back to the `General Information` tab and copy the `Client ID`. Paste that as `BOT_ID` in your `.env` file.

Next, head over to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and either [set up an account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/get-started-with-mongodb-atlas/) or sign in. Choose the database you'd like to use, and get your connection string. Paste that as `MONGO_URI` in your `.env` file.

The bot uses two Discord webhooks, one for debug logging and one for moderation action logs. For the purposes of local testing, you can use the same webhook URL for both. Right click on a channel in your server, select `Edit Channel`, and pick the `Integrations` tab on the sidebar. Click the `Create Webhook` button, give it a name, and copy the URL. Paste that as `DEBUG_HOOK` and `MOD_HOOK` in your `.env` file.

Right click on your Discord server icon (the one you'll be running the bot in) and select `Copy ID`. This goes in your `.env` file as `HOME_GUILD`.

> **Note:**
> This bot is designed for a single-guild use case. Commands will only be registered in the server specified by `HOME_GUILD`.

Finally, for the private conversation system you need to specify a moderation role (which gets added to each ticket) and the category private channels should be opened in. Right click on the role you'd like to use and select `Copy ID`. Paste that as `MOD_ROLE` in your `.env` file. Right click on the **category** you'd like to use and select `Copy ID`. Paste that as `PRIVATE_CATEGORY` in your `.env` file.

## Preparing the Code

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Build the code:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Inviting the Bot

To add the bot to your server, head back to your application page on the developer portal, select the `OAuth` tab, select `URL Generator`, and check the `bot` and `application.commands` scopes. A second section to select permissions will appear. Check the following permissions:

- Manage Channels
- Manage Roles
- Kick Members
- Ban Members
- Time out members (or Moderate Members)

Copy the URL and open it in a new tab. Select the server you'd like to add the bot to and click `Continue`. Click `Authorize` to add the bot to your server.

## Gateway Intents

Discord marks specific gateway intents as "privileged". Back on your application page, select the `Bot` tab, and scroll down to the `Privileged Gateway Intents` section. Check the following intents:

- Server Members Intent
- Message Content Intent

## Running the Bot

Finally everything should be set up to run the bot. Start it with:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see the bot come online, and a message sent to your debug webhook letting you know the bot is ready.
