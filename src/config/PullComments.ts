    message:
      "Hello,\n\nFirstly, thank you for submitting this pull request!\n\nAs you navigate through the process, we have a PR checklist to ensure consistency and quality in our contributions. We kindly ask that you genuinely follow through with each point. This not only facilitates the review process but also demonstrates a mutual respect for the community's efforts.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with certain aspects, our [contributing guidelines](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org) are a helpful resource to get you up to speed.\n\n<details>\n<summary>**Friendly Pointers (click to expand)**</summary>\n\n1. **Editing on GitHub:** While it's possible to edit files directly on GitHub, it's typically better not to. This helps avoid inadvertent mistakes like typos that can disrupt tests.\n\n2. **Pull Request Title:** Please ensure the PR title follows [our convention](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/how-to-open-a-pull-request?id=prepare-a-good-pr-title).\n\n3. **Linking Issues:** Please ensure you link issues using the designated method. Simply update the `XXXXXX` in the PR description to include the issue number. This keeps our records organized and clear.\n\n4. **Engaging with the Team:** We know you're eager, but kindly keep mentions and review requests limited. Our maintainers are always on the lookout and will attend to PRs in the order they come in.\n\n5. **Branch Management:** It's a good practice not to work directly off your `main` branch. Creating separate branches for different changes allows you to smoothly update your PR even as the main repository progresses.\n\n</details>\n\nPlease note, there's no need to close this PR. If you have questions or need guidance refining your contribution, don't hesitate to ask. Our community is here to assist.\n\nThank you for your enthusiasm in contributing to our project. We eagerly await more contributions from you!\n\n**Happy Contributing!** üåü"
